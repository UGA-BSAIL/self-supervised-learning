    Workaround for a bug in TF 2.4 where we can't input `y_true` as a
    ragged tensor. However, `y_pred` can still be ragged, so in this
    situation, we convert `y_true` to a ragged tensor based on the row
    lengths from `y_pred`.

    Args:
        y_true: The ground-truth labels.
        y_pred: The predicted labels.

    Returns:
        The same true and predicted labels. In the case where `y_pred` is
        ragged and `y_true` is not, `y_true` will be made ragged. Otherwise,
        both will be returned unchanged.
